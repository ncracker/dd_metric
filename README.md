# Sending metrics to Datadog
Submit metrics to Datadog API with PowerShell using native PS constructs

### dd_metric.ps1
Basic example, which submits a metric in the "ps1" namespace.

### dd_metric_func.ps1
Broken down with a couple of functions, making it easier to reuse in bigger projects.

See https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/ for details.
